# SussySort

## How does it work?

1. While the list is not sorted and its length is greater than 0, a random passenger (sus) is selected.
2. The other passengers then vote on whether sus is really a imposter or just a crew member.
3. If more than half of the passengers think he is an impostor, he is ejected.
4. This process continues until the list is sorted or only one passenger remains.
